The initial aim is to stress a Google Cloud Function that is HTTP triggered and whose task is mostly limited to
publishing the message that is given to it to a Google PubSub Topic.

A message should be ~20K in size

There should be these levels of parallelism for message producers/posters:
    1
    2
    4
   10


Any producer should be provided at startup time at least two arguments:
     total number of messages, rate per second 
     optional messages might be pairs of message-types/% of the whole
     with a default message type for a "normal" message and a percentage of 100%
     any optional non-normal messages would take a chunk of that 100% 


There should be some mechanism to uniquely identify the parallelism element sending the message as 
well as a unique sequence number for the message from that element.
 
   bonus changing various attribute values for the message
